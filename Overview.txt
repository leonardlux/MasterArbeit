Idea:
Find theoretical limit of coherent information under which error correction still possible.

types of error correction (using teleportation): 
	knill
	steune

find analytical mapping between coherent information and order parameter (from classical statistics)

-> find phase transition (numerical simulation needed)
-> limit of coherent information for eacht type of error correction

need to now: (both in quantum info lecture)
- how to work with gates 
- open quantum systems

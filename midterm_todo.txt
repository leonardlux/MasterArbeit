Todo List:
ML Decoder debugging 
multiple round independent decoding 
	- should I switch the original state (+|>)
	- correction by pauli frame tracking (add to syndrome)
	- p_L/round

error model propagation 
	- calc error model (correlated) on all 3 qubits
	- dont force them to be independent (maybe try)

mapping to 2 2d ising models  (2 coupled 2D RBIM)
	-> determine fundamental threshold (distrubted? vortex model)
	-> (cheat) back engineer error model with isotropic model
	
ML Decoder with corrlated X and Z noise

Look at the logical encoding

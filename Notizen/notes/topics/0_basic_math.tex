\section{Mathematical Basics and Notation}


\subsection{States}\label{sec:basic.math.states}
A state is a mathematical entity that embodies the knowledge of the quantum system.
We gonna use qubit states (2-level states).
Short for 'quantum bits' and they form the most basic unit of a quantum computer.\footnote{
    Possible realizations: photons, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, 
spins in semiconductors etc..}

The mathematical notation is the Dirac bra-ket notation. 
The computational basis is given by $\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$ (eigenstates of Pauli Z Op. for single qubit case).
Therefore the general qubit takes the form 
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{\Phi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}.
\end{equation*}


For multi qubit systems, implicit labelling is assumed ($1,...,n$)
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{010} = \ket{0}_1 \otimes \ket{1}_2 \otimes \ket{0}_3.
\end{equation*}


\subsection{Bloch-Sphere}\label{sec:basic.math.bloch_sphere}
Based on $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2=1$, one can represent this state using a Bloch-Sphere, with the equation:
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{\Phi} = cos(\theta /2) \ket{0} + e^{i\phi} sin(\theta/2) \ket{1}
\end{equation*}
where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the angles in sperical coordinate system (fig. \ref{fig:bloch_sphere}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bloch_sphere.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Bloch-sphere, and conventional names for the eigenstates. }
    \label{fig:bloch_sphere}
\end{figure}

A nice explanation why the bloch sphere appears can be found in this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEzmw6cKOlU}{video}.
The Bloch sphere is the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}P^1$. \footnote{therfore homomorphic to $S^2$, not SU(2)}


\subsection{Hilbert Spaces of a Qubit}\label{sec:basic.math.hilbert_space}
One qubit is represented by $\mathbb{C}^2$. 
(With normalization condition $\rightarrow$ in the end not a real vector room (addition under closure).)
But the physics aspects lives only on the Bloch sphere due the normalization condition. 
Therefore the physics is located in the Projective Hilbert Space $\mathbb{C}P^1$.

We can still calculate multiple Cubits using the tensor product of multiple Hilbert spaces:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 (N \text{ times}) \cong \mathbb{C}^{2^N}
\end{equation} 
But the true physics is only relevant in the projective space: $\mathbb{C}P^{2^N - 1}$

\subsection{General Operators}


\subsection{Pauli Operators}\label{sec:basic.math.pauli_operator}
The Pauli group on a single-qubit $\mathcal{P}_1$ is a 16-elements group consisting of the Pauli matricies: 
\begin{equation}
\mathds{1} = 
\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix},
X = \sigma_x =
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix},
Y = \sigma_y =
\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{pmatrix} ,
Z = \sigma_z =
\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix} ,
\label{eq:basic.math.pauli_matricies}
\end{equation}
muliplied each by $\pm1$ and $\pm i$. 
It is closed under multiplication. 

The general Pauli group $\mathcal{P}$ consists of all operators that are formed from tensor products of the elements of $\mathcal{P}_1$. 
For example, the operator
\begin{equation}
    \mathds{1} \otimes X \otimes \mathds{1} \otimes Y \in \mathcal{P}_4
    \label{eq:basic.math.ex_pauli_op}
\end{equation}
is an element of the four-qubit Pauli group. 

The \textit{support} of a Pauli operator is given by the list of its non-identity elements.
For example the support of the operator (eq. \ref{eq:basic.math.ex_pauli_op}) is written as $X_2Y_4$.
The indicees point to the qubit each element acts on.\footnote{This is completly stolen from QEC Introduction} \cite{QECintro}

The \textit{weight} $|P|$ of a Pauli operator $P=P_1 \otimes... \otimes P_n \in \mathcal{P}_n $ is 
the number of qubits on which it acts nontrivially/the number of single-qubit Pauli operators 
$P_i$ that are unequal to $\mathds{1}$. \cite{QECmemory}

\subsubsection{SU(2)}
$SU(2)$ is the group of the operators for a qubit, not the state itself!
We only need 2 generators to construct this group.
\textcolor{red}{I need to spent some time on this.}


\subsubsection{Commutators}
The elements of the Pauli group have eigenvalues ${\pm 1,\pm i}$.
And their commuatation realtion can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    [\sigma_j,\sigma_k] = 2 i \epsilon_{jkl} \sigma_l
\end{equation}

Another important property is:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} + i \epsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k
\end{equation}

Therefore we only need 2 Pauli operator to construct the Pauli group.
\begin{equation}
    X Z = - Z X = -2 i Y = c Y, \ c \in \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}
In the following we will often use the Pauli $XZ$ operators to replace the $Y$ operator.

Pauli operators which act on two different qubit will always commute!
Pauli operators that act on mulitple qubits commute if they interact non-trivially on an even number of qubits.
If the numer is odd they anticommute.


\subsubsection{Eigenstates}
Each Pauli Operator has a corresponding eigenstate, which is shown on the Bloch sphere (fig. \ref{fig:bloch_sphere}).

We first once again define the kets in the same basis as the pauli matricies

\begin{equation}
   \ket{0}  \doteq  \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), \ket{1} \doteq \left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    Z \ket{0} = 1 \ket{0}, Z \ket{1} = -1 \ket{1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\pm}  =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( \ket{0} \pm  \ket{1}) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   X \ket{\pm} = \pm1 \ket{\pm} 
\end{equation}

We don't care about the $Y$ Pauli operator beacuse it can be constructed from $XZ$ operators.

Conventionaly we use $\ket{0},\ket{1}$ as computational basis.


\subsubsection{Associated Errors}
If an $X$ Operator is erronous applied, it leads to a bitshift. 
\begin{equation}
    X\ket{0} = \ket{1}
\end{equation}
Types of erros applying the $X$ Op. are called \textit{bitflip errors}.

The erronous application of the $Z$ Pauli op. is called a \textit{phaseflip error}, because 
\begin{equation}
    Z \ket{\pm} = \ket{\mp}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Projection Operators}\label{sec:basic.math.projection_operator}
A projection operator fullfills the condition $P^2=P$.
We will later see that projection operators are so called \hyperref[sec:basic.qc.stabilizer]{stabilizer}
\textcolor{red}{The wording here seems to be wrong}.


\subsection{Gates}\label{sec:basic.math.gates}
Gates just represent the application of operators to the qubits. 
We use a circuit notation to represent the operations we are doing.
\textcolor{red}{I need to spent time on getting used to those!}


\subsubsection{Pauli Gates (X,Y,Z)}\label{sec:basic.math.gates.paui}
These are type of single qubit gates. And they are just realized by applying the pauli operators. 
\textcolor{red}{Add some example to get to know the instantly!}


\subsubsection{Hadamard Gates (H)}\label{sec:basic.math.gates.hadamard}
The Hadamard gate take the following form.
\begin{equation}
H=    
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1  \\
1 & -1  
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\textcolor{red}{No prefactor?}

And it transforms the computational basis into the eigenstates of the $X$-Operator.

\begin{equation}
    H\ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{1}) = \ket{+}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    H\ket{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} - \ket{1}) = \ket{-}
\end{equation}
\cite{QECintro}


\subsubsection{Control Gates (CNOT)}\label{sec:basic.math.gates.cnot}
\textcolor{red}{Add circuit diagramm}
A controlled gate is a gate whose action is conditional of a 'control' qubit.
The control link is marked by a black dot and a connection to the gate which act on the target state. 
The control only activates the gate on the target qubit if the control qubit is in state $\ket{1}$.

The CNOT gate is the controlled-NOT gate, consisting of a control link connected to a $X$ op.. 
This gate is marked with a black dot on the control qubit and a symbol with an empty circle with a plus inside.


\subsection{No Cloning Theorem}\label{sec:basic.math.no_cloning_theorem}
You can not simple clone a quantum state. 
This hinders the application of usual error correction codes.

The no-cloning theorem states, that it is not possible to construct a unitray operator $U_{clone}$, such that 
\begin{equation}
    U_{clone} (\ket{\Psi} \otimes \ket{0} ) \rightarrow \ket{\Psi} \otimes \ket{\Psi}.
\end{equation}
\cite{QECintro}


\subsection{Wavefct. collapse/Measurements}\label{sec:basic.math.wavefct_collpase}
Measurements prepare a quantum state/force them into the corresponding eigentstate of the measurement.
Therefore the parts of the quantum information contained in the state are destroyed.


\subsection{Entanglement}
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\Psi} = \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{11}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Minimal set}\label{sec:basic.math.minimal_set}

A minimal set $\mathcal{S}= \langle S_1,...,S_m\rangle$ is a set, 
in which is is not possible to obtain one element $S_i \in \mathcal{S}$ 
as a product of any other elements  $S_i \ne S_j \cdot S_k \forall (i,k)$. \cite{QECintro}

The elements $S_1, ..., S_m$ are by this notation the generators of the group $\mathcal{S}$.



\subsection{How to not change information contained in the state}
The quantum information is contained in the $\alpha,\beta$ coefficients of each state.
All operators which commute with the logicals operators $\bar{X},\bar{Z}$ do not change the quantum information. \cite{QECmemory}
\textcolor{red}{Check if correct!}


\subsection{Linear codes}\label{sec:basic.math.linear_codes}
A linear code is an error-correcting code for which any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_code}{Source: Wikipedia} 

\subsection{Computational Space/Basis}
'Qubits can encode information in a superposition of their basis state $\rightarrow$ computational space scales as $2^n$.' \cite{QECintro}
Computational space is just the conventional name for the definition of the 'main' axis and the corresponding space.

\textcolor{red}{What exactly is the difference to classical computing, the data stored also scales with $2^n$, where $n$ is the amount of bits.
How can we say it as simple as said there?
This might be two times in this summary

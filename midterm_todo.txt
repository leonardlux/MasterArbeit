Todo List:

ML Decoder fertig machen
multiple round independent decoding 
	- p_L/round

error model propagation (paper by manuel and david?)

mapping to 2 2d ising models  (2 coupled 2D RBIM)
	-> determine fundamental threshold (distrubted? vortex model)
	-> (cheat) back engineer error model with isotropic model
	
ML Decoder with corrlated X and Z noise

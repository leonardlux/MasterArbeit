\section{Meeting}

\subsection{What I did}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 week student job work + 1 week sick :(
    \item Markus lecture block regarding QEC
    \item Workshop Maarten QEC conditions
    \item Paper: "Quantum data processing and error correction"
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Topics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Von Neumann entropy  (recap)
    \item Superoperators (recap)
    \item (Entanglement) fidelity
    \item Entropy exchange 
    \item Coherent information
    \item Quantum data processing inequality
    \item Perfect error correction 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy exchange, just decoherence of entanglement state towards the enviorment (information outflow)
    \item Coherent Information, information capacity of the transport channel?
    \item Entanglement fidelity, lowerbound for average fidelity, what else?
    \item Perfect error correction, Coherent information = von neumann entropy of the state (no information outflow towards the enviorment)
    \item product states as the opposite of purified states (in the sense of completly correclated vs completly uncorrlated)
    \item relvance/origin of Fano inequality
    \item Schmidt Decomposition 
    \item Open/closed system formalism
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Road ahead}
\begin{itemize}
    \item work through once agian Workshop QEC  
    \item maybe summarize coherent information and related topics
    \item some application to get a good grasp of the concepts (Lecture exercises)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Topics I might need spend time on/have skipped}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formalism of subsystem stabilizer codes
\end{itemize}

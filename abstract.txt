Fault-tolerant quantum computing relies on quantum error correction (QEC) schemes whose performance can be characterized by a threshold: a critical physical error rate below which logical errors can be suppressed by increasing the code distance. In this thesis, we investigate the threshold for a Steane type error correction circuit which performs syndrome extraction by logical encoded ancillas and therefore offers a fault-tolerant and single-shot capable way of syndrome extraction. We determine the logical error rate under a circuit level noise model with faults in gate operations and measurements, under the assumption that we have access to fault tolerant prepared logical ancilla states encoded with the surface code. Decoding is performed using an efficient maximum likelihood decoder designed for the surface code. By simulating repeated rounds of syndrome extraction and decoding, for different code distances, we identify the threshold as the physical error rate at which logical error rate curves for different distances intersect.

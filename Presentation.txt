Presentation:

- Goal:
Title: Finding the "threshold(s)" for "steane type ec"

- Introduce basics: (4 pages)

Surface Code (unrotated, for reasons) 		(1 Page)
Noise model and the occurence noise, circuit noise 
Basic EC measuring multiple times stabilizer

Basics of Steane Type EC			(2 Pages)
-> WHY steane,one shot, fault tolearance 

Threshold(s) 		(1 Page)
-> differents between finding a threshold and finding a optimal one (ala ML)
-> why is it difficult and why is the optimal one more interesting?

-> Why did nobody do this before?
 - nn interaction
 - expensive in qubits 

- inital approach:

apply a ML Decoder for surface code (not ML on steane type ec) to steane type ec circuit => hope for the best
						(1 Page)	
						
-> introduce the eff ML Decoder workings on surface codes (only bit flips -> to phase flips) (how thorougly)
						(2-x pages)
-> steps to use this ML on the steane type 
	-> error propagation			(1 Page)
	-> explain assumptions and following limitations think about that one again
- is it ML decoding for steane type?
						(1-2 Page)
-> show some results if we apply it to steane type ec (bit flips and phase flips only)
	-> limitations already
						(1 Page) = 11 pages

explain why it might not work (not decode in ML style)
						(1 page)

future steps: 					(1 page)
- some smart idea to adapt this process to apply it to steane type EC?
- use the non bit flip adapted ML Decoder 
	-> alread some problems with changing error rates? is it though?
	

Questions: 
Which error model(s)?
-> Circuit level
Valid to assume fault tolerant encoding of qubits or should i do something about that?
